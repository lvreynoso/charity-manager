## About
Super secret contractor project.
## Running
* Clone project and run `npm install`.

* Make sure `mongod` is running.
* Start with `npm start`.
## Testing
* You can run automated tests using Mocha and Chai with `npm test`, but they don't work even though manual testing reveals everything to be fine so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
