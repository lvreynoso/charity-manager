## About
Super secret contractor project.
## Running
* Clone project and run `npm install`.
* Set the environment variables `CHARITY_NAV_APP_ID`, `CHARITY_NAV_API_KEY`, and `CHARITY_NAV_BASE_URL` with your Charity Navigator App ID, Charity Navigator API key, and the Charity Navigator base url accordingly.
* Make sure `mongod` is running.
* Start with `npm start`.
## Testing
* You can run automated tests using Mocha and Chai with `npm test`, but they don't work even though manual testing reveals everything to be fine so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.
